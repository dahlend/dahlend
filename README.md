### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dar Dahlen, I'm a physicist/programmer.

Since 2018 I have been working at [Quantum Benchmark](https://quantumbenchmark.com/about-us/) where I am the lead developer of [compilation tools](https://trueq.quantumbenchmark.com/) for state of the art quantum computers.

Before this I was working more directly with Quantum Computing hardware:

- [Superconducting Quantum Chips](http://qnl.berkeley.edu/) - 2016-2018 - full stack development from hardware/FPGA interfaces up to Python, along with hardware development.

Previously, I used to primarily work in optics, usually big lasers:

- [Kilowatt IR Lasers](https://www.nlight.net/) - 2013-2014
- [ML work with biological data](https://www.stowers.org/scientists/c-ron-yu) - 2014-2015
- [Petawatt femto-second lasers](https://bella.lbl.gov/) - 2015-2016


This is my personal website where I may post personal projects, thoughts, or whatever else comes to mind, and is not representative of my employers (past or present).
